I am Tal, a 23-year-old software engineer from Israel with a deep passion for technology and software development.\nAfter completing my military service as a full stack engineer, a temporary contract at a startup, and reserve duty, I decided to take a career break and travel through South America. During my travels, I decided to start job hunting. I purchased a laptop, worked on small projects, and began sending out resumes.\n\nTo make the most of this journey, I decided to track and document my job search process. This helped me monitor my progress, identify areas for improvement, and gather valuable insights. Additionally, I wanted to share my experience to help others navigate their own job search journeys. I realized that this process can be long and challenging, so I aimed to provide useful knowledge and guidance to fellow candidates.\n\nEvery journey is different. Everyone starts from a different point. Making comparisons is natural, but don't underestimate or overestimate your own journey. Some people might get hired by the first company they encounter, while others might need to apply to hundreds of jobs. Still, it should be clear that getting hired in the Hi Tech job market is not easy at all for most of us, and it requires a lot of effort, patience, and persistence.\n\nI started working on my job search process while traveling, telling recruiters I would only return home in two months. This isn’t so appealing to many companies. Additionally, the ongoing war has had a massive negative impact on the local job market.\n\n**However, these kinds of obstacles will not stop me! Neither should they stop you!** \n\nMy journey is ongoing, and I am still looking for a job. However, I am excited to continue learning, growing, and maybe even inspiring others along the way.\n\n---\n\n### Skills\n- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, WPF, Chakra UI \n- **Backend**: C# .NET Core, Python, Node.js, REST APIs  \n- **Databases**: MongoDB, MSSQL, Redis  \n- **Tools**: Git, Consul, Openshift, Wireshark, Visio  \n- **Soft Skills**: Problem Solving, Team Collaboration, Autodidact  \n\n---\n\n### Goals\n\nMy goal is to join a company where I can contribute to meaningful projects while continuing to learn and grow as a developer. I'm particularly interested in full stack or backend development and creating efficient and reliable systems."
